## Welcome to my GitHub. ðŸ‘‹



I will upload two new repositories by October 15, 2023, after formatting and reviewing my work.

- Predicting and determining the factors that lead to attrition prediction
- A Google Analytics Capstone Project for Fitbit Data (in RStudio)

I am a passionate learner with a diverse range of interests and skills. Recently, I completed a Master of Science in Business Analytics - Data Analytics. I am actively seeking an environment that fosters continuous learning and professional development, where I can further apply my current skills and expand my knowledge.

Some of my interests are data science, psychology, languages, economics, and science. 

In my free time, I enjoy exercising, hiking, reading books, listening to podcasts, using Duolingo, watching Crash Course, reading The Economist, investing, and traveling. 

My favorite foods are passion fruit, coconut water, and chocolate. Trilingual (Spanish, English, and Portuguese).
